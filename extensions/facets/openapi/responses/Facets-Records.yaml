  This response extends the OGC API - Records - Part 1: Core records response with a `facets` object.

  The response includes a facets object. The content represents an object of all facets available for that response,
  each containing various buckets describing different facets of the search result. A facet is identified by a
  property identifier and contains the top number of buckets with their respective count. A bucket is a number of
  results in the result set matching the property. The facets object may also indicate how many buckets were omitted
  in order to keep the response size low (e.g. 0 if all buckets were included in the overview), via the more property.
