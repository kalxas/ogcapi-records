NOTE: This is accomplished by a server providing HTTP validator fields describing the state of a resource and evualting preconditions submitted by clients about the current state of a resource that the client wants to change. See <<rfc9110,RFC 9110 (HTTP Semantics)>>, section 8.8. If the validator in a client request does not match the state of the resource on the server, the operation fails and the client must re-fetch the resource and retry the update operation based on the new state.
