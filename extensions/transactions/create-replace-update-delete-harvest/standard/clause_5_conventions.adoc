== Conventions and background

=== General remarks

See <<OAFeat-1,OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core>>, Clauses 5 and 6.

=== Identifiers

The normative provisions in this Standard are denoted by the URI `http://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-records-3/1.0`.

All requirements and conformance tests that appear in this Standard are denoted by partial URIs which are relative to this base.

=== Sequence diagrams

This Standard uses sequence diagrams to illustrate the flow of requests and responses between client and server.

The token `<resources endpoint>` is used for an endpoint that accesses
resources from a collection. 

EXAMPLE 1: For records, these endpoints are described by the 
URI template `{landingPageUri}/collections/{catalogId}/items`. See <<OARec-1,OGC API - Records - Part 1: Core>>.

EXAMPLE 2: For processes, these endpoints are described by the 
URI template `{landingPageUri}/process`. See <<OAProc-1,OGC API - Processes - Part 1: Core>>.

The token `<resource endpoint>` is used for the endpoint that accesses a specific 
resource from a collection.

EXAMPLE 3: For records, these endpoints are described by the 
URI template `{landingPageUri}/collections/{catalogId}/items/{recordId}`. See <<OAFeat-1,OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core>>.

EXAMPLE 4: For processes, these endpoints are described by the 
URI template `{landingPageUri}/process/{processId}`. See <<OAProc-1,OGC API - Processes - Part 1: Core>>.

=== Dependencies to other requirements classes

The requirements classes in this extension distinguish two types of dependencies to other Standards or requirements classes:

First, there are the "direct dependencies". Every server implementing the requirements class has to conform to the referenced Standard or requirements class.

In addition, requirements classes can also have "indirect dependencies". Servers implementing the requirements class do not have to conform to the referenced Standard or requirements class, but if they do, they have to conform to the requirements that identify the indirect dependency as a pre-condition for the normative statement.
