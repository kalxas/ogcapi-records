[[records_clause]]
== Requirements Class "Records"

=== Overview

include::requirements/requirements_class_records.adoc[]

This clause defines requirements for the case when the resource type is a
record.

[[records-endpoint]]
=== Resources endpoint

include::requirements/records/REQ_resources-endpoint.adoc[]

[[record-endpoint]]
=== Resource endpoint

include::requirements/records/REQ_resource-endpoint.adoc[]

[[put-create-record]]
=== Support for creating records using the PUT method

include::requirements/records/REQ_collection-endpoint.adoc[]

[[record-crs]]
=== Coordinate reference systems (CRS)

Unless the server supports <<OAFeat-2,OGC API - Records - Part 2: Coordinate Reference Systems by Reference>>, all geometries have to be submitted in the default CRS.

include::requirements/records/crs/REQ_crs84.adoc[]

If the server supports <<OAFeat-2,OGC API - Records - Part 2: Coordinate Reference Systems by Reference>>, the default CRS can be overridden by declaring the `Content-Crs` header in the request. Alternatively, if the record representation supports expressing CRS information for each record / geometry, the information can also be included in the record representation.

include::requirements/records/crs/REQ_content-crs-header.adoc[]

include::requirements/records/crs/REQ_default-crs.adoc[]

include::requirements/records/crs/REQ_other-crs.adoc[]

This approach is consistent with the use of WGS84 longitude/latitude as the default CRS for all record-related requests in API implementation instances. If both the server and the client are CRS-aware and have the capability to handle geometries in other CRSs, this requirement enables the client to negotiate to some other mutually agreeable CRS.

*Example*

The following example adds a new record to the `dc_buildings` collection.  The record is represented as GeoJSON and the `Content-Crs` HTTP header is used to assert that the geometry coordinates are expressing using CRS http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/32607 (WGS 84 / UTM zone 7N).  A pseudo-sequence diagram notation is used to illustrate the details of the HTTP communication between the client and the server.

include::../examples/json/ex05_create-crs.adoc[]

If the server includes the `storageCrs` property in the Collection resource, as specified in <<OAFeat-2,OGC API - Records - Part 2: Coordinate Reference Systems by Reference>>, then it is recommended that client express all geometry-valued record properties presented to the server in a request body using the storage CRS. This avoids geometric errors from the conversion of coordinates on the server when storing the geometry.

include::recommendations/records/REC_storage-crs.adoc[]

[[schemas]]
=== Feature schemas

Adding, replacing, or updating a record requires that a representation of that record or the updated properties be provided by the client. As is the case in Part 1 (Core), this Standard does not mandate that a specific record encoding be supported by a server.

If records in a collection are constrained to a specific schema and schema information is provided by a server, the Schema resource of a collection is available at `{landingPageUri}/collections/{collectionId}/schema` as specified by Part 5 (Schemas). This information enables clients to generate record representations that are acceptable to the server. 

include::requirements/records/REQ_schema.adoc[]

The schema identifies the record properties that can be used in a mutation request (Receivables), that is, all properties that are not tagged as `readOnly`.

The mapping between the properties in the encoded record and the properties in the JSON Schema depends on the record encoding. This Standard provides guidance for API implementation instances that support GeoJSON.

*Example*

The following example fetches the schema for the `oakland_buildings` collection. Pseudo-sequence diagram notation is used to illustrate the details of the HTTP communication between the client and the server. Remarks:

- Since the schema includes a statement `"additionalProperties": false`, the server will reject any record that has additional properties that are not specified in the schema.
- The `id` member is read-only as the record identifier is assigned by the server on a POST request. In a PUT or PATCH request, the record identifier is part of the URI.

=== JSON Merge Patch

<<rfc7396,RFC 7396 (JSON Merge Patch)>> can be used to update selected properties of a record, if the schema of the record as described in the previous sub-clause is available. This is independent of the record encodings supported by the API.

include::requirements/records/REQ_update-json-merge-patch.adoc[]

[[record-geojson]]
=== GeoJSON

include::requirements/records/REQ_geojson-create-replace.adoc[]

GeoJSON normatively supports WGS84 longitude/latitude, but the https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7946.html#section-4["prior arrangement" provision] allows that other CRSs can be used if both client and server agree on the CRS. Clients that want to use a CRS that is not the default CRS have to state the CRS in the POST, PUT or PATCH request using the `Content-Crs` HTTP header to invoke the "prior arrangement" provision.
