== Scope

This Standard specifies an extension that defines the behavior of a server
that supports operations to add, replace, modify or delete individual records 
from a catalog.

NOTE: Additional OGC Standards are planned to handle transactions that require batch or atomicity semantics.

Specifically, this Standard specifies:

* How to add a new record instance to a catalog (i.e. create).

* How to modify an existing record from a catalog: This includes entirely replacing the existing record (i.e. replace) or simply modifying one or more properties of a record (i.e. update).

* How to remove an existing record from a catalog (i.e. delete).

The following table crosswalks each of the record endpoints discussed in this
Standard with the HTTP methods POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE.  Each intersecting
cell in the table either contains the name of the operation for that 
combination of record(s) endpoint and HTTP method or it contains the
phrase "n/a" which is used to indicate that this Standard does not
specify any behavior for that combination of resource endpoint and HTTP 
method.

|Resource endpoint 4+|HTTP method

The option to create a new resource with PUT is conditional and depends on the characteristics of the collection.
