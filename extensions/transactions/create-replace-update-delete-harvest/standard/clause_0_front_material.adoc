[big]*i.     Abstract*

OGC API standards define modular API building blocks to spatially enable Web APIs in a consistent way. The <<OpenAPI,OpenAPI specification>> is used to define the API building blocks.

OGC API - Features - Part 4: Create, Replace, Update and Delete Standard (hereafter also referred to as "this Standard" or "this document") defines the behavior of an API that allows resource instances to be added, replaced, modified and/or removed for a collection.

NOTE: This Standard was developed in the Features API SWG but is being written as a generic extension that is applicable to a variety of resource types including features.  The feature-specific portions of this extension are isolated to the clause titled <<features,Features>>.  It is anticipated that the bulk of this extension will eventually be moved into 'OGC API - Common' and only the feature-specific content will remain to be managed by the Features API SWG.
