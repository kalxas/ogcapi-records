          If records are encoded in-line within the catalog object,
          this member advertises the name of the array member that 
          contains the catalog records.  By default the name of the
          records array is "records".  However, the name of this 
          array member may be different.  A local resources catalog
          is an example of a circumstance where the records array
          member may be named something other than "records".  For
          example, in the case of a local resource catalog at the 
          /collections endpoint, the name of the records array is
          "collections".

          The items schema is intentionally general (i.e. object)
          to accomodate records that have been extended beyond
          the core record schema.
