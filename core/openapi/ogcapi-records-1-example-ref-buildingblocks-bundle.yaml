  title: "OGC API - Records - Part 1: Core"
  version: '1.0.0'
  description: |-
    This is a sample OpenAPI definition that conforms to the conformance
    classes "Core", "GeoJSON", "HTML" and "OpenAPI 3.0" of the draft
    standard "OGC API - Records - Part 1: Core".

    This example is a generic OGC API - Records definition that uses path
    parameters to describe all record collections and all records.
    The generic OpenAPI definition does not provide any details on the
    collections or the record content. This information is only available
    from accessing the record collection resources.

    There is [another example](ogcapi-records-1-example2.yaml)
    that specifies each collection explicitly.

        collection of records of a similar type, based on a common schema.
