  title: "OGC API - Records - Part 1: Core"
  version: '1.0.0'
  description: |-
    This is a sample OpenAPI definition that conforms to the conformance
    classes "Core", "GeoJSON", "HTML" and "OpenAPI 3.0" of the draft
    standard "OGC API - Records - Part 1: Core".

    This example is a generic OGC API - Records definition that uses path
    parameters to describe all record collections and all records.
    The generic OpenAPI definition does not provide any details on the
    collections or the record content. This information is only available
    from accessing the record collection resources.

    There is [another example](ogcapi-records-1-example2.yaml)
    that specifies each collection explicitly.

        * A list of coordinate reference systems (CRS) in which geometries +
          may be returned by the server. The first CRS is the default +
          coordinate reference system (the default is always WGS 84 with +
          axis order longitude/latitude);
        * An optional title and description for the collection;
        * An optional extent that can be used to provide an indication of +
          the spatial and temporal extent of the collection - typically +
          derived from the data;
        * An optional indicator about the type of the items in the collection +
          (the default value, if the indicator is not provided, is 'record').

    Records:
      description:
        The response is a document consisting of records in the collection.
        The records included in the response are determined by the server
        based on the query parameters of the request. To support access to
        larger collections without overloading the client, the API supports
        paged access with links to the next page, if more records are selected
        that the page size.

        The `bbox` and `datetime` parameter can be used to select only a
        subset of the records in the collection (the records that are in the
        bounding box or time interval). The `bbox` parameter matches all records
        in the collection that are not associated with a location, too. The
        `datetime` parameter matches all records in the collection that are
        not associated with a time stamp or interval, too.

        The `limit` parameter may be used to control the subset of the
        selected records that should be returned in the response, the page size.
        Each page may include information about the number of selected and
        returned records (`numberMatched` and `numberReturned`) as well as
        links to support paging (link relation `next`).
