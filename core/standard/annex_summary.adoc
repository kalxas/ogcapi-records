== Implementation summaries (Informative)

=== Overview

This annex presents implementation summaries for the crawlable catalog
searchable catalog and local resources catalog deployment patterns.
This information is meant to be a short guide for developers.

=== Crawlable catalog

To implement a catalog where records are stored as individual files in one or more web-accessible locations and can be crawled by simply following hypermedia controls.

* For each discoverable resource create a file that contains a summary description of the resource using the record schema defined in <<core-properties-record-table>> and <<core-properties-resource-table>>.
* Extend the record schema to enrich its content as necessary.
* To make the resource discoverable, place each record file in a web-accessible location, preferably co-located (e.g., in the same directory or object store location) with the resource that the record is describing.
* Optionally create a file containing a description of a <<sc_record-collection-overview,_collection_>> of related records.
* Also place the collection file in a web-accessible location.

=== Searchable catalog

In order to implement a catalog where records are stored in some backend database and are accessed through an access/search API:

* implement the http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-069r3/17-069r3.html[OGC API - Features - Core: Part 1] Standard;
* implement the parameters defined in <<core-query-parameters-table>>;
* implement the record schema defined in <<core-properties-record-table>> and <<core-properties-resource-table>>; and
* extend the record schema to enrich its content as necessary.

=== Local resources catalog

In order to implement a local resource catalog at an OGC API resources endpoint such as `/collections` for example:

* implement the endpoint as per the relevant OGC API Standard;
* enhance the information content of the resource using the mandatory and optional parameters defined in <<core-properties-resource-table>>;
* implement the query parameters defined in <<core-query-parameters-table>>; and
* optionally implement <<clause-filtering,filtering>>, <<clause-sorting,sorting>>.
